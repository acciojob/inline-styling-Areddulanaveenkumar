		<p>Flowers have four main parts: petals, sepals, stamen, and carpel.1 The petals are conspicuously colored and attract pollinators.0 The stamen is the pollen-producing part of the flower, usually with a slender filament supporting the anther. The anther is the part of the stamen where pollen is produced. The pistil is the ovule-producing part of the flower.2 Flowers consist of vegetative organs that enclose and protect the developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the anthers.</p>
